# Bundles

Bundles is an abstract and flexible data modeling library that focuses on ease-of-use.

Bundles allows engineers to easily design application save data structure from the top down by describing the data's final layout rather than working from the runtime data structure outward.

## Installation

The easiest way to include Bundles in your project is via the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MRWilliams.Bundles).
